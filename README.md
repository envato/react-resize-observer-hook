# React `ResizeObserver` Hook &amp; Context &middot; [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-v2.0%20adopted-ff69b4.svg)](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

> Observe multiple React components with a single ResizeObserver.

This package provides you with:

* a single `ResizeObserver` instance placed inside a React Context;
* a React Hook to observe any element's changes in size.

This allow you to know the size of each observed element.

# Developer status

While this package has seen little action "in the wild", it has first been developed and groomed elsewhere. As such, I don't expect a lot of changes conceptually. However, the API of this hook is not finalised and may change at any given time.
