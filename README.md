> Observe multiple React components with a single ResizeObserver.

This package provides you with:

* a context `<Provider>` with a `ResizeObserver` instance;
* a `useResizeObserver()` hook to observe any element's changes in size.

This allows you to know the size of each observed element.

# üöß Developer status

While this package has seen little action "in the wild", it has first been developed and groomed elsewhere. As such, I don't expect a lot of changes conceptually. However, the API of this hook is not finalised and may change at any given time.

# üìö Docs

This package was developed **and documented** as part of the [`@envato/react-breakpoints`](https://github.com/envato/react-breakpoints) package. It's separated into its own package because I believe it can be used separately if you don't need all the abstractions that React Breakpoints gives you. Please refer to the [React Breakpoints API Docs](https://github.com/envato/react-breakpoints/docs/api.md) for more details about `<Provider>` and `useResizeObserver()`.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

```shell
npm install @envato/react-resize-observer-hook
```

## Set up the provider

```javascript
import { Provider as ResizeObserverProvider } from '@envato/react-resize-observer-hook';

const App = () => (
  <ResizeObserverProvider>
    ...
  </ResizeObserverProvider>
);
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution** ‚Äî You may need to pass some props to `<Provider>` to increase browser support. Please refer to the [React Breakpoints API Docs](https://github.com/envato/react-breakpoints/docs/api.md#provider).

## Observe an element

```javascript
import { useResizeObserver } from '@envato/react-resize-observer-hook';

const ObservedDiv = () => {
  const [ref, observedEntry] = useResizeObserver();
  const { width, height } = observedEntry.contentRect;

  return <div ref={ref}>This element is {width}px wide and {height}px high.</div>
};
```

Depending on your implementation of `ResizeObserver`, the internal `ResizeObserverEntry` can contain size information about multiple "boxes" of the observed element. Observing these boxes instead of `contentRect` (default) can be done by passing an options object to the hook:

```javascript
const options = {
  box: 'border-box'
};

const [ref, observedEntry] = useResizeObserver(options);
```

See [MDN reference guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver) for further information.
